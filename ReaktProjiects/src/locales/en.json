  "our_history_description": "The history of our atelier began with a small workshop in a cozy part of the city. There were only three of us then — a tailor, a designer, and a person with a dream to create something more than just a sewing business. We believed that clothes could be not just a thing, but a reflection of personality, character, a confident presentation to the world.",
  "our_history_description_2": "We took our first orders right at home. People came by recommendation, and every client was not just satisfied — they became our friend. We listened, advised, looked for the best fabrics, experimented with cuts, were inspired by world fashion and at the same time preserved the individuality of each order.",
  "our_history_description_3": "Over the years, new masters joined us — true professionals, with experience, taste, and hands that feel the fabric. We began to grow: opened the first branch, then the second. Each has its own atmosphere, its own face, but the common spirit is style, respect for the client, and love for the craft.",
  "our_history_description_4": "Opening each new atelier is not just expansion, it is a philosophy. We select the place, the team, train employees to our standards — quality, precision, attention to detail. Everywhere our logo appears, a person should feel: here they will be helped, understood, and the best will be created.",
  "our_history_description_5": "During our work, we have completed thousands of orders: from everyday shirts to wedding dresses, from restoring expensive suits to creating stage images. Our clients were businessmen, artists, teachers, teenagers for whom we sewed for graduation — and everyone got what they wanted.",
  "our_history_description_6": "We are proud that people come back to us. People trust us with their appearance for the most important events in their lives — interviews, weddings, presentations, photoshoots. We justify this trust with quality, attention and a human approach.",
  "our_history_description_7": "We do not just sew — we create mood, confidence, aesthetics. And if a person in our clothes feels comfortable, smiles at themselves in the mirror and feels confident — then we have done everything right.",
